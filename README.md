## Introduction

High-fidelity 3D face reconstruction from a single image is a challenging task in computer vision. While significant progress has been made in shape reconstruction, generating realistic facial textures with high-frequency details remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel **coarse-to-fine approach** for UV albedo map generation, which combines a **UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM)** with a **detail generator** to produce high-quality facial textures from a single image.

Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of texture quality and realism, making it suitable for applications in VR/AR, face recognition, and animation.

## Method Overview

Our method consists of three main stages:

1. **Coarse Albedo Generation**: We use a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM) to generate low-resolution albedo maps with basic skin tones and low-frequency details.
2. **Detail Generation**: A detail generator, trained using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), is employed to add high-frequency details such as wrinkles, whiskers, and spots.
3. **Rendering**: The final albedo map is rendered using a differentiable renderer, producing realistic 3D face models.

The pipeline is illustrated in the figure below:

## Usage

### 1. Generating UV Albedo Maps

To generate a UV albedo map from a single image, run the following command:

```bash
python generate_albedo.py --input_image path/to/your/image.jpg --output_path path/to/save/output
```

### 2. Training the Detail Generator

To train the detail generator on your own dataset, use the following command:

```bash
python train_detail_generator.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### 3. Rendering 3D Faces

To render a 3D face model using the generated albedo map, run:

```bash
python render_3d_face.py --albedo_map path/to/albedo_map.png --output_path path/to/save/render
```
